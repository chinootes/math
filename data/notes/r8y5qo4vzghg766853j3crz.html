<p>It shows that in any axiomatic system will always be "incomplete". That is, there will always be certain statements in any axiomatic system, which will be true, but cannot be proven.</p>
<p>These unprovable true statements exist in every axiomatic system, making it impossible to create a "complete" axiomatic system.</p>
<p>Even if you add such true statements as <a href="/math/notes/8dv4ywxz6x7ct9o3zwq6j8w">Axioms</a> to the system, that would create even more such "unprovable" true statements.</p>
<p>Before Godel, it was always believed, that every true statement can be proven, based on certain axioms.</p>

<p>Consider the below statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above statement can be true or false. But by referring to itself, the statment creates a <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">#paradox. (Private)</a> Creating such a self-referential paradox by words is easy. But mathematical equations don't refer to themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To create such a statement, Godel came up with a numbering systems for mathematical objects, logical formulas, proofs, and other structures within formal systems using natural numbers. The key idea is to assign unique numerical codes (Gödel numbers) to each symbol, formula, or object in the system, allowing them to be manipulated and reasoned about within the framework of arithmetic.</p>
<p>  Prime numbers were assigned to basic symbols. For formulas, which are combination of these basic symbols, the numbers were multiplied/exponentiated.</p>
<p>  Using this system, he created the first self-referential mathematical equation, essentially saying "This statement cannot be proven".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now mathematical equations cannot end up in paradoxes as the statement above. The statement must be true or false. </p>
<p>  If it is false => It has a proof => It is true => <strong>A true statement that cannot be proved</strong>.</p>
