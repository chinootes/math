Matrix representing [[games]].

1. The [[games.comps.players]] are represented as the two axes.
2. The [[games.comps.strategy]]s for each player are represented as the rows and columns.
3. The [[games.comps.payoffs]] are mentioned inside the cells of the matrix.

    Payoffs are listed in order X, Y. That is, payoffs for player whose strategies are listed in rows or x-axis (in this case, player A) are written first, followed by payoff for the player whose strategies are written in columns or y-axis (in this case, player B).
