Systems exhibit emergent properties that arise from the interactions and relationships between their components. Emergent properties are characteristics or behaviors of the system as a whole that cannot be explained solely by the properties of individual components. These properties may include self-organization, complexity, stability, or resilience.


For example, culture of an organization.
