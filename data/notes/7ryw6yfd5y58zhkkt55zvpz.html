<p>Most of the game theory today originated because of mathematician, physict and computer scientist named John von Neumann.</p>
<p>Neumann wanted to develop mathematics of life itself, using poker as the means. He wanted to develop a general theory, that can be applied to diplomacy, love, war, evolution or business strategy.</p>
<p>In his book with Oskar Morgenstern titled "The Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour", they asserted that any economic situation could be defined as the outcome of a game between two or more players.</p>
