Noises are random or uncertain elements in a "game". This is almost always encountered in real-life scenarios. This can completely change the outcome of a game as this could mean that a player tried to cooperate but it came across as deflection, or vise-versa.

For example, in 1983, the Soviet satellite-based early warning system detected a launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the US, but the US hadn't actually launched anything. The Soviet system had confused sunlight reflecting off of high-altitude clouds with a ballistic missile. Thankfully, Stanislav Petrov, the Soviet officer on-duty dismissed the alarm.
