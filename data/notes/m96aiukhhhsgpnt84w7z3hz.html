<p>Players are <em>rational</em> agents in a game capable of making decisions and responding to other players actions. However the rational part is debatable. </p>
<p>Almost all theories are based on the assumptions that agents are rational players who strive to maximize their <a href="/math/notes/mcp2dqp2rfxphsb3puf9wus">Payoffs</a>, yet studies demonstrate that players do not always act rationally (big surprise!). Thus, the conclusions of rational analysis sometimes fail to conform to reality.</p>
<p>The players share a common knowledge of the rules, available strategies and possible payoffs. However, its not necessary that players always have perfect knowledge of these elements.</p>
