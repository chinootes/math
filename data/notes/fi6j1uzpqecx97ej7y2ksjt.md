Scaling is the process of increasing/decreasing magnitude at which a mathematical entity operates by multiplication/division of the entity as a whole while preserving the information/behavior of the entity.

This operation typically manipulates the magnitude  - enlargening (scalling up) or reducing the magnitude (could be size, intensity, quantity or parameter).
