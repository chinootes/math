Players are _rational_ agents in a game capable of making decisions and responding to other players actions. However the rational part is debatable. 

Almost all theories are based on the assumptions that agents are rational players who strive to maximize their [[games.comps.payoffs]], yet studies demonstrate that players do not always act rationally (big surprise!). Thus, the conclusions of rational analysis sometimes fail to conform to reality.

The players share a common knowledge of the rules, available strategies and possible payoffs. However, its not necessary that players always have perfect knowledge of these elements.
