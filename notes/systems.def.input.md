Inputs are external factors, stimuli, or resources that enter the system from its environment. Inputs provide the system with the necessary energy, information, or materials to function and to produce outputs. Inputs can include physical inputs such as energy or matter, informational inputs such as data or signals, and environmental conditions that affect the system.
