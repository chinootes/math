All of mathematics is based on the axiomatic method.

## The Axiomatic Method

**Axioms**: Basic truths. E.g. One line through two points kinda stuff. But these can be arbitrary in a mathematical system.

Theories are formulated and proved based on the axioms.

For example,

Axiom 1: All dogs are red.
Axiom 2: Nick has a dog.

Theory: Nick's dog is red.

Proof: From axiom 1 and 2 => Nick's dog is red. Q.E.D.
