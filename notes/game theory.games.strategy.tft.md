Tit for tat is a [[game theory.games.strategy.characteristics.nice]], [[game theory.games.strategy.characteristics.forgiving]] and [[game theory.games.strategy.characteristics.provokable]] [[game theory.games.strategy]], which starts with cooperating(nice), but retaliates if the opponent defects(provokable). Although, it doesn't hold grudges and starts cooperating again, right from the next move if the opponent also cooperates.


## Other versions

### Tit fot two tats

It is a more [[game theory.games.strategy.characteristics.forgiving]] version of tit-for-tat, which retaliates if the opponent defects twice in a row.

### Generous Tit for tat

Generous TFT makes TFT 10% less [[game theory.games.strategy.characteristics.provokable]]. That is, it would retaliate 9 out of every 10 times. 

## Loopholes

While TFT comes out on top in general, there are certain scenarios where TFT can lead to a chain of continous defections.

For example, when playing with a little sneaky version of itself, Joss. Joss is same as TFT, but it sneaks in a defection 10% of the time to see how the opponent would react. 

When playing with Joss, both would start well. But as soon as Joss defects, TFT and Joss would get stuck in an alternating cycle of cooperate and defect. What is worse is if Joss defects twice, then its endless defection for both leading to a lose-lose situation.

In such cases, being a little forgiving might be helpful. So TFTT might help. Although, it also has a loophole. It might be a little too forgiving.

Since it only retaliates if the opponent defects twice in a row, any strategy which defects alternatively would never trigger retaliation in TFTT.

## Breaking out of echo effects and accounting for [[game theory.noise]] - Self-healing with GTFT

In situation like the one mentioned above, or when there is some defection due to [[game theory.noise]] in the system, it might help to be a little more forgiving and allowing the system to self-heal, by not-deflecting everytime the opponent deflects.  

So when a system falls into a cooperating and defecting back and forth, or even a continuous defection, the strategy can maybe for once ignore a defection and let the opponent have a chance to change. If it does, well and good, both players might be back to cooperating again and end up in a win-win situation. 

This can be achieved by GTFT, which doesn't retaliate 10% of the time.

## Misconception - TFT can never do better than its opponent

By design, TFT can only loose or at best have a draw with its opponent. 

On the other hand, the "Always deflect" strategy will always draw or win.

While this is true in a one on one game series with a single opponent, most of life is not like that. When there are multiple agents involved with, different strategies and different [[game theory.noise]]s at play, the results are totally different. [[game theory.games.prisoners dilemma]] is a [[game theory.games.characteristics.non-zero sum]] game. Therefore, TFT is not always getting its reward from other player.

In such games, winning is not as important as securing the most number of points. Since you are not getting your reward from the other player, but from a third-party. And TFT eventually ends up gaining most points even by just drawing most games. While,
