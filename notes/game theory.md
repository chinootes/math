Study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents.


## Origins

Most of the game theory today originated because of mathematician, physict and computer scientist named John von Neumann.

Neumann wanted to develop mathematics of life itself, using poker as the means. He wanted to develop a general theory, that can be applied to diplomacy, love, war, evolution or business strategy.

In his book with Oskar Morgenstern titled "The Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour", they asserted that any economic situation could be defined as the outcome of a game between two or more players.
