- A collection of interconnected or interdependent components or elements that work together to achieve a common goal or function. 
- These components can be physical entities, abstract concepts, or processes. 
- Systems can range from simple, such as a mechanical gear system, to highly complex, like an ecosystem or an economic market. 

## Systems Theory

Systems are often studied to understand their structure, behavior, and dynamics, with the goal of predicting or controlling their outcomes.
